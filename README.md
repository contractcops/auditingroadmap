An open source repository, dedicated towards creating a journal of free materials for learning smart contract development & auditing.

The repository currently contains a summary of:

- Mastering Ethereum book (summary with extra information/graphs)
- PoS

- Cryptography in blockchains
- Common security issues found in contracts
- Token standarts (ERC20, ERC721, etc.)
- Ethereum blocks & their contents

We encourage you to take a look and fork the repository. Feel free to correct/add new material and send a pr, we would love to keep it open source and add more valuable materials.
